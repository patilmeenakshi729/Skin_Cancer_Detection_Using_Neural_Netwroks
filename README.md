# Skin Cancer Detection Using Neural Networks

📍 **Project:** MSc Data Science, University of Sussex (2022)

📄 **File:** [Skin_Cancer_Detection_MSc_Project.pdf](SKIN_CANCER_DETECTION_USING_NEURAL_NETWORKS.pdf)  

🏷️ **Keywords:** Deep Learning, CNN, Image Classification, ISIC Dataset, HAM10000

This research explores how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automate the detection of melanoma and other skin lesions using open-source datasets. Tools and techniques discussed include:
- Neural Network architecture design
- Feature extraction and image pre-processing
- HAM10000 & ISIC datasets
- Model performance and validation

📈 Achieved classification accuracy comparable to dermatologists using InceptionV3 and ResNet-based models.
